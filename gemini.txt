To align with 2026 payment trends while keeping your PostgreSQL project manageable with three tables, you should focus on Agentic Commerce and Digital Wallets.
In 2026, the industry is shifting from manual clicks to "AI Agents" making autonomous purchases within pre-defined budgets and "Tokenization" where real card numbers are replaced by merchant-specific tokens.

The Recommended 3-Table Schema
To build a modern REST service that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, use these three tables:

Table Name          Primary Purpose                                       Modern Trend Feature
accounts	        Stores user/agent profiles and current balances.      Include an is_agent boolean to support Agentic Commerce.
payment_methods	    Stores "Tokens" instead of raw credit card numbers.   Use Network Tokenization by storing a token_id and method_type (e.g., Apple Pay, Stablecoin).
transactions	    Tracks the movement of money between accounts.        Include a status field (Pending, Completed, Failed) to handle Instant Payments.

Technology Stack Selection
Language choice: Python 3.11+ (specifically with FastAPI) In 2026, "Agentic Commerce" and AI-driven payments are almost exclusively built in Python because it has the best libraries for AI integration (like LangChain or Pydantic).
Framework: FastAPI (Modern, high-performance, and handles asynchronous payments perfectly).

ORM (Database Mapper): SQLAlchemy or SQLModel (This allows the agent to write Python code that "talks" to PostgreSQL).

Validation: Pydantic (To ensure the payment data is strictly formatted).

Detailed CRUD Requirements
Accounts: POST /accounts (Create an AI Agent account), GET /accounts/{id} (Check balance).
Payment Methods: POST /methods (Add a new Tokenized payment method).
Transactions: POST /transactions (Execute a transfer).
Logic: This endpoint must check if the account has enough balance before creating a transaction record.
Transaction Atomicity: All payment transfers must use PostgreSQL Transactions (ACID). If a balance deduction from Account A fails, the credit to Account B must not happen, and no transaction record should be created.

The Database Setup Command
Provide a docker-compose.yml file or a setup script to spin up a local PostgreSQL instance.
final instruction:

I have an implementation plan for a Python FastAPI REST service using PostgreSQL.

Please initialize the folder structure.

Create a .env file for database credentials (use placeholders).

Implement the three tables: accounts, payment_methods, and transactions.

Ensure the transaction logic supports 'Agentic Commerce' as defined in my plan.

Provide the requirements.txt and a README with instructions on how to run it.
